# StarWarsMemory

Star Wars Memory is a fun game of memory where you pick matching cards to win the game.
The challenge is that you have to accomplish this task in under 30 seconds.

You start by clicking the start button at the bottom of the page.
This will start the game and the timer so, no time to waste.

If you can match all the cards in under 30 seconds you Win!
If the clock runs out you lose!

If you would like to play again, just hit the reset button,
and when you have built up your courage, hit start and go for it!

TECHNOLOGIES

The game is designed in HTML, CSS where the page layout and styling take 
place. JavaScript is the heart of the game where all the functions live.
I also used some jQuery to simplify some of the code.

DESIGN

My design started with my common knowledge of the game memory. I started by 
doing several wire frames to get an idea of what I wanted my final project to
look like. I then wrote over a dozen user stories mapping out the process I 
planned on using along with breaking each step into bite size pieces. 

GET STARTED

To get off on the right foot, I used Trello to map out my user stories into
the working compoinents of icebox, sprint and done.

NEXT STEPS

In my icebox I have several ideas to improve the existing game. Some of those 
ideas include animations to have the cards more 3D on click. 
I also would like to include audio and sound effects that would be triggered
when a pair is matched. Similar to a lightsaber battle.
