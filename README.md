## Intro

Get ready to enter into epic battle of memory. Your mind is a terrible thing to waist, some
people say it is the first thing to go, so let's see how much of yours is left. 

Star Wars Memory is a fun game of memory where you have a dozen cards face down.  
The challenge is that you have to find matching cards by picking two at a time in under 30 seconds.

###How to Play


>1) To start, click the start button at the bottom of the page. This will start the game and the timer so, no time to waste.   

>2) After you recover from Hyper-speed sickness, pick a card. You will see an image on the first card, now pick a second card and try to find the match.    

>3) Both cards will be displayed for a flash so pay attention. If the cards match they will stay on the screen, if they are not the cards will flip back to face down.   

>4) In order to win, you must match all the cards in the deck in under 30 seconds and you Win! No problem right?  
>
But if the clock runs out you lose!

>5) If you would like to play again, just hit the reset button, and when you have built up your courage, hit start and go for it!

**May the Force be with you!**

###TECHNOLOGIES

The game is designed in HTML, CSS where the page layout and styling take 
place. JavaScript is the heart of the game where all the functions live.
I also used some jQuery to simplify some of the JavaScript code. I pushed
the entire game to GitHub so that my progress could be tracked and each 
step would be saved. I then pushed to GH Pages so the rest of the world could
enjoy the game.  

###DESIGN

My design started with my common knowledge of the game memory. I started by 
doing several wire frames to get an idea of what I wanted my final project to
look like.

I then wrote over a dozen user stories mapping out the process I planned on using along with breaking each step into bite size pieces. [Trello Link](https://trello.com/b/BDu2GqX6/memory-card-game) I organized 
each action item into categories like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This helped me 
organize each step and also served as a reminder to push to GitHub often.

###NEXT STEPS

In my icebox I have several ideas to improve the existing game. Some of those 
ideas include animations to have the cards more 3D on the flip feature. I also am working on different levels of difficulty where the clock gives you more or less time depending on what level you pick.
